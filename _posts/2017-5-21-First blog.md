## Just built a blog by using github.

###### Nothing really interesting or exciting that I want to post or share.

I made a plan to finish Learn python the hard way in 2 weeks. 
I created this blog to keep track of my progress each day and see if I would reach my goal.

I will be using the resource on [learnpythonthehardway](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/).
