## Workday Three

I went to school to take the stats exam and watched a movie.


I barely completed 20% of my assigned task today, but I did put more than 50% of the scheduled time.

This is really getting hard... There're lots of things that don't make sense to me at this moment, I'll have to commit more time into learning this.

Hopefully, I could still achieve my goal...
